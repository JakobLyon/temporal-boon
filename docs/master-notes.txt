todo:
1. open dropdown with pepe icon

todo 7/24

include redux, reselect
include react table
setup some basic structure
merge to master
setup bosses + spells in redux + selectors

healer types + their big cds

paladin-
* aura mastery
* avenging wrath
* holy wings

shaman -
* healing tide totem
* mistress' water
* magic tsunami

Use Case -
As a user, I need to be able to select which healers i have in my raid

multiselect?

healers = ['holyPaladin', 'restoShaman']

cdsByHealer = {
	'holyPaladin': [
		'aura mastery',
		'avenging wrath',
		'holy wings'
	],
	'restoShaman': [
		'healing tide totem',
		'gamer girl bath water',
		'magic tsunami'
	]
}

cds = {
	'aura mastery': {
		name: 'Aura Mastery'
		// other data
	},
	'avenging wrath': {
		name: 'Avenging Wrath'
	}
}

// add to each time we add a healer
// when removing a healer, remove only their cds
cdsToPlot = {

}

cdsToPlotReducer = (state, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case 
	}
}

Use case -
As a user, I need to be able to plot my healers cds

healerTypes = {
	'hpal': {
		type: 'hpal',
		cds: [
			'aura mastery',
			'avenging wrath'
		]
	},
	'restoShaman': {
		type: 'restoShaman',
		cds: [
			'healing tide totem',
			'gamer girl bath water'
		]
	}
}

currentHealers = [
	{
		id: 1,
		spec: 'hpal',
		cds: [
			'aura mastery',
			'avenging wrath'
		]
	},
	{...},
	...
]

availableCds = [
	'aura mastery 1',
	'avenging wrath 1',
	'aura mastery 2',
	'avenging wrath 2'
];

mappedCds = [
	'aura mastery 1'
];

Current issue:
I'm storing activeHealers as just strings of the healer names.
this causes an issue where updating activeHealers causes some ordering issues because its removing the first instance of that healer isntead of the actual instance we have.

This should be solved in the next step, when we need to map each healers cds. We need to mark each healer with a unique id, so we can tell which cds belong to that healer.

next step: brainstorm redux structure for tracking healers cds

healers = {
	1: {
		id: 1,
		type: 'Resto Shaman',
		cds: [
			'water',
			'totem'
		]
	}
}

selector for available cds (used as options for cd dropdown)
const getAvailableCDs = (state) => {

}

ENDGOALs: 
1. options for cd dropdown

what shows up in this cd dropdown?

for example:
we have selected 3 healer types
1. hpal
2. water shaman
3. holy priest

collect their cds: those are your options
other features?
1. used cds do not reappear
2. removing a healer resets any dropdowns using their cds

PROBLEM
I need a unique identifier for each healer, but I need to reconcile this id between
how it will be represented in DB

SITUATION:
SELECTED [Resto shaman, resto shaman, resto shaman]
cds: [bath water, spirit totem]

how do we tie each cd to its respective healer
gotta be an id of some sort


FIRST STEP, fix active healer shape
DONE

next: retool healers again
must be per boss
