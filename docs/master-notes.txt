visualization timeline?
healer comp dropdowns
cooldowns
boss ability dropdowns
cooldowns not usable if not off cd (need to store ability details)

drag and drop?

1. react table - hard coded data fed in

redux:

normalized data w/ reselect

raids = {

}

todo:
1. open dropdown with pepe icon
2. style
3. label
4. make dropdown its own component

todo 7/24

include redux, reselect
include react table
setup some basic structure
merge to master
setup bosses + spells in redux + selectors

healer types + their big cds

paladin-
* aura mastery
* avenging wrath
* holy wings

shaman -
* healing tide totem
* mistress' water
* magic tsunami

Use Case -
As a user, I need to be able to select which healers i have in my raid

multiselect?

healers = ['holyPaladin', 'restoShaman']

cdsByHealer = {
	'holyPaladin': [
		'aura mastery',
		'avenging wrath',
		'holy wings'
	],
	'restoShaman': [
		'healing tide totem',
		'gamer girl bath water',
		'magic tsunami'
	]
}

cds = {
	'aura mastery': {
		name: 'Aura Mastery'
		// other data
	},
	'avenging wrath': {
		name: 'Avenging Wrath'
	}
}

// add to each time we add a healer
// when removing a healer, remove only their cds
cdsToPlot = {

}

cdsToPlotReducer = (state, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case 
	}
}

Use case -
As a user, I need to be able to plot my healers cds

healerTypes = {
	'hpal': {
		type: 'hpal',
		cds: [
			'aura mastery',
			'avenging wrath'
		]
	},
	'restoShaman': {
		type: 'restoShaman',
		cds: [
			'healing tide totem',
			'gamer girl bath water'
		]
	}
}

currentHealers = [
	{
		id: 1,
		spec: 'hpal',
		cds: [
			'aura mastery',
			'avenging wrath'
		]
	},
	{...},
	...
]

availableCds = [
	'aura mastery 1',
	'avenging wrath 1',
	'aura mastery 2',
	'avenging wrath 2'
];

mappedCds = [
	'aura mastery 1'
];

Current issue:
I'm storing activeHealers as just strings of the healer names.
this causes an issue where updating activeHealers causes some ordering issues because its removing the first instance of that healer isntead of the actual instance we have.

This should be solved in the next step, when we need to map each healers cds. We need to mark each healer with a unique id, so we can tell which cds belong to that healer.

next step: brainstorm redux structure for tracking healers cds

healers = {
	1: {
		id: 1,
		type: 'Resto Shaman',
		cds: [
			'water',
			'more water',
			'gamer girl bath water'
		]
	}
}

cds = [
	{

	}
]
